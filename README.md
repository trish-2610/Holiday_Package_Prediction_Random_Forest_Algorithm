# House Package Prediction - Classification_Model.ipynb
## Project Overview
Trips & Travel.Com aims to grow its customer base by offering tailored travel packages. Currently, the company offers five packages: Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, and King. However, a random approach in customer outreach resulted in high marketing costs last year, with only 18% of customers purchasing a package.

To improve efficiency, the company plans to use customer data to target potential buyers better. They are introducing a new product called the Wellness Tourism Package, which focuses on promoting healthy and well-being-focused travel.

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of customers purchasing a travel package, leveraging data analysis and machine learning. This will help the company reduce marketing costs and effectively reach interested customers.

The dataset used for this project contains 20 features and 4,888 rows, sourced from Kaggle: Holiday Package Purchase Prediction Dataset.

# Used Car Price Prediction - Regression_Model.ipynb
## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features. The dataset, scraped from CarDekho.com, includes important attributes of cars sold in India.

The objective is to build a model that can predict car prices based on input features like age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, etc. This prediction can help new sellers get a **price estimate** based on current market trends.

Dataset : Contains 13 features and 15,411 records of used cars.
